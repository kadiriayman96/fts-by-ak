# Future School Talents by Ayman Kadiri

This project is a web application that allows students to track their learning difficulties (blocages) and trainers to validate and manage these difficulties.

## Project Overview

As a student, you can add new blocages with a title, brief description, and difficulty level encountered. You can also edit or delete your blocages if they haven't been validated by a trainer yet. Once a difficulty is resolved and validated by a trainer, the delete option will be disabled.

Trainers have the ability to view a chronological list of blocages submitted by students, validate resolved difficulties, and specify the resolution methods used by the student.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the application, including CSS variables for customization.
